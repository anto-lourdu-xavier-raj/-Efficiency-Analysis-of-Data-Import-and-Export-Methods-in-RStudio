# In this project task, an R Markdown document was created to explore different methods of importing and exporting data in RStudio. The project began by updating the document setup to handle errors during rendering. Taylor Swift song data was imported from a CSV file using the read_csv() function, and a subset of the data was displayed using the slice_tail() and select() functions from the dplyr package. Import times were compared for three different functions (read.csv(), read_csv(), and fread()) using the bench package, and the results were visualized using a violin plot. The fastest import function was determined based on the plot. Similarly, export times were compared for write.csv(), write_csv(), and fwrite() functions, and the results were visualized using another violin plot to identify the fastest export method. The findings were presented in the resulting HTML document, demonstrating the efficiency of different data import and export techniques in R.
